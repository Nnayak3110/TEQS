# Question 1 (c)

# Defining the circuit and the initial state |psi> = |00>
circ3 = QuantumCircuit(2)
psi3 = Statevector.from_label('00')

# Build your circuit here
circ3.h(0)
circ3.x(1)
circ3.h(1)
circ3.cx(0,1)

# Draw the circuit you built
circ3.draw('mpl')

# Evolve the Statevector based on the circuit you constructed:
psi1.evolve(circ3)
